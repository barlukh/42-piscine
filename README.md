## About
This is a collection of all my succesfully completed exercises during the Piscine at Hive Helsinki (42-school). Only the exercises that passed both the Moulinette and Norminette were uploaded to this repository.
Main functions are missing and need to be written by the user in order to test the code. The syntax could have been improved in few of the exercises, and some tasks could have been done recursively.
This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.
